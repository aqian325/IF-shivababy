      Thanks for playing along. <br><br>This piece was inspired by Shiva Baby (2020) by Emma Seligman, which features a young woman (Danielle) who attends a Jewish funeral service with her parents and is forced to keep up with different versions of herself. Once at the shiva, Danielle is pelted with one awkward conversation after another, fielding inquiries from well-meaning but nosy and intrusive family friends who seem to want to offer unsolicited advice, live vicariously through her, and judge her life choices, all at the same time. She is forced to defend (or more accurately, endure interrogations of) every single life choice, and this puts her struggles and insecurities about her career goals and sexual identity on public display. 

      <br><br>The movie was marketed as a comedic drama, but it’s the definition of horror for me – the film exacerbates these feelings of anxiety (and, I’d argue, terror) with its increasingly claustrophobic shots (Danielle is trapped in the house hosting the shiva – a haunted house) and score fit for a psychological thriller. Each conversation, each newly introduced character, is a jump scare, and Danielle can’t seem to escape. Just like in a classic haunted-house movie, Danielle is stuck in a predicament partially of her own making and partially due to external factors beyond her control. 
      
     <br><br> I related to Danielle’s struggle with different versions of herself – and struggling to explain and defend those identities to everyone from your mother to random acquaintances. I wanted to play up the anxiety-inducing elements of the movie. Even without the film score and and framed shots, the conversations from the movie and what they imply is terrifying enough. Pop-up windows, which often indicate errors, seemed like an appropriate digital analogue for conversations in the movie.       
    <br><br> This piece was created for Professor Lawrence Evalyn’s interactive fiction class, in which we explored agency and procedural rhetoric in interactive fictions of the last fifty years, with an emphasis on feminist and queer interaction fiction subcultures. In particular, I was interested in works that use interactivity to toy with the player/reader’s feeling of agency and ultimately produce a feeling of catharsis. How do we engage with conversations in the game (or in real life) and how much agency do we have in those choices?     <br><br> april qian, spring 2024
